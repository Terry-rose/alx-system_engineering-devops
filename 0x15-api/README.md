# API Data Gathering

This project contains Python scripts that fetch and display the TODO list progress of an employee from a REST API, and export the data to CSV and JSON files.

## Usage

Run the script with an employee ID as the argument to display the TODO list progress:

```sh
./0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee_id>
