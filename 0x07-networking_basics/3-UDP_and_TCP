# The correct answer to the second question is:
# 2. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might lose data along the process
# Explanation: UDP is a faster and connectionless protocol, but it may not guarantee delivery and can result in data loss.

# The correct answer to the third question is:
# 1. Have you received boxes x, y, z?
# Explanation: TCP ensures the ordered and reliable delivery of data, so it may check if the recipient received specific data packets.
